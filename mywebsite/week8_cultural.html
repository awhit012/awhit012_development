    <h2>Pairing</h2>
      
      <h3>What its like</h3>
        <p>I thought I would be bad at working with someone, but I think I am good at it! I thought it would be very difficult to me to problem solve with another person because I assumed I would be too in my own head. It turns out having someone else there can help guide my thought and keep me from going off on a tangent or getting lost! In the context of DBC prep, it is great to see that other people are on the same page as me as far as progress. </p> 
      <h3>What is fun</h3>
        <p>It is really fun to bounce ideas around! Its fun when I'm lost and my pair has an idea. Its fun when my pair is lost and I have an idea.</p>
      <h3>What is difficult</h3>
        <p>Communication is one of the most important and challenging things about being a human. I had one pair that went badly. I was exhausted and really not up for it, but I felt obligated to try my best. I should have communicated how I was feeling instead!</p>

    <h2>Feedback</h2>
      
      <h3>How's it feel?</h3>
        <p>It feels great to get good positive feedback! It feels less than great to get negative feedback at first. But after a few breaths, if its helpful, it can be transformative!</p>
      <h3>Is it helpful?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes! Usually actually. Just for some reinfocement at the very least. At best an actionable piece of advice! One example that I recieved said that I should communicate better when I was thinking or looking something up so I'm not just dead air.
      <h3>Whats it like to give feedback?</h3>
        <p>For me giving feedback is more difficult than recieving. I'm sure I will get better at it as I get more comfortable pairing. I think the barrier is that I tend to be more concerned with how I am doing and don't notice what my pair could be doing better.</p>
      <h3>Using pairing and feedback to guide learning</h2>
        <p>I think this is an excellent way to guide learning. Every time I have had anxiety about my level of understanding, after I pair that anxiety has gone away. I discover that someone else feels the same way, and dispite our anxiety we solve the problem together. Then the next time I feel less anxious. I'm getting to where I am feeling confident going in to our final week of prep, and pairing has a LOT to do with it. </p>
